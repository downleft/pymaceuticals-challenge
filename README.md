# pymaceuticals-challenge
Module 5 Challenge - Use data and starter code provided within course curriculum to analyze a hypothetical reseach study on the effectiveness of treatments for squamous cell carcinoma.

## Running the code
The file to use for analyzing the data is entitled Pymaceuticals_Analysis.ipynb . 
This file was put together and runs using Jupyter Notebook.

Within the data folder, there are two csv files: Mouse_metadata.csv and Study_results.csv

## Applications of the code
The Pymaceuticals_Analysis.ipynb is set up to do the following:
- Read preexisting csv files and merge the information into a single dataframe
- Calculate summary statistics regarding tumor volume as it relates to the treatment given
- Compare treatments based on change in tumor volume throughout the study, with a focus on a particular medication (Capomulin)
- Create data frames, bar charts, pie charts, box plots, scatter plots, and regression lines to aid in analysis
